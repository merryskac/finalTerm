## API Structure
```Client sending request``` -> ```server.js``` -> ```router files, handle specific path```->```controller files, handle req, res```->```use case files, call model function```->```model files, use mongoose function```->```grab data from MongoDB```->```Data go to model files as return```->```model files return data to usecase files```->```use case files process datas and return it to controller files```->```controller files handle data and make it a JSON response```->```Data go to router files as return```->```give result to client```

so files in order:
```server.js (/play)```

```router files (channel, comment, product, account)```

```controller files (channel, comment,product, account)```

```use case files (channel, comment, product)```

```model files (channel,comment, product, account)```

## HOW TO RUN
1. This database is now running in my MongoDB Atlas, so it's accessible online.
2. You can see this api in this link
   https://final-term-git-main-wheytosharepalu-gmailcom.vercel.app/
   use the instruction up there for the endpoints


P.S. I hope this instruction is clear, and hopefully I can get max Grade for this mid term in this GIGIH 3.0 Program âœŒ
