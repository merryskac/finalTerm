## API Structure
```Client sending request``` -> ```server.js``` -> ```router files, handle specific path```->```controller files, handle req, res```->```use case files, call model function```->```model files, use mongoose function```->```grab data from MongoDB```->```Data go to model files as return```->```model files return data to usecase files```->```use case files process datas and return it to controller files```->```controller files handle data and make it a JSON response```->```Data go to router files as return```->```give result to client```

so files in order:
```server.js (/play)```

```router files (channel, comment, product, account)```

```controller files (channel, comment,product, account)```

```use case files (channel, comment, product)```

```model files (channel,comment, product, account)```

## HOW TO RUN
1. Open your VSCode or terminal 
2. Make sure you have installed "NodeJs". If you haven't, you   can get it here:\
    NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en
3. Clone this repo locally in your computer using terminal
\
  ```git clone https://github.com/merryskac/PlayAPI.git ``` \
  and then do on your terminal\
  ```cd PlayAPI```

5. On your terminal, do
```npm install``` to install necessary package for this program

6. Make sure you have installed "MongoDB Compass" on your computer. You can get it from https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass

7. On MongoDB Compass, connect to the Database with URI
 ```mongodb://localhost:27017``` OR ```mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017```

8. On your terminal, type 
```node server.js```

9. On your terminal, there will be message
```
server Open!
Database Connected!
```

9. Now you can use the API. the base URL is 
```localhost:3000```\
Make sure this port is clear.
You can try with your browser, or Postman App, or terminal using curl.

10. Once the program is running, this program automatically insert a document of data to the database if you don't have the same database. so, if you do (example) ```GET /play/thumbnail``` for the first time, even you have not insert any data yet, you will get document as a response.

P.S. I hope this instruction is clear, and hopefully I can get max Grade for this mid term in this GIGIH 3.0 Program âœŒ
